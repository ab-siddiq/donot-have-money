                                    You can start investing with Ekush with very small amount. Systematic Investment
                                    Plan (SIP) allows you to invest at least Tk.1,000.00 (multiple of Tk. 1000.00) on
                                    monthly basis. It will help you to build savings habit. It will bring the necessary
                                    discipline in life.

                                         <strong>    Cost-Averaging will minimize the market timing risk:</strong> For example, you invest
                                            5,000 taka monthly. Say, the first buy price of the fund is 10 taka per
                                            unit. hence, you will get 500 units of fund.
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="">
                                            Here is a hypothetical table provided below showing, how cost gets averaged
                                            over time with changes in per-unit price:

                                            After one year, you will give Tk. 60,000 with average at 10.78 and total
                                            unit will be 5,582.
                                            Your investment shall grow to BDT (5,582 X 11.8) = 65,869 which is equal to
                                            10% return.

                                            Due to cost averaging, the difference between minimum & maximum return is also narrowed down with increase in investment horizon.

                                          <strong>   No worries about market timing:</strong> Share market is full of ups & downs. You want to be in the “up” not the “down”. That’s why people often ask “when’s the right time to get in the capital market??”  
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="">
                                            But through SIP you do not need to time the market.

                                            Because, a) through SIP an investor is not investing directly in the stock market rather in a mutual fund which is a diversified fund.  Mutual funds invest into fixed income securities & stock markets. And b) through cost averaging, you are getting more units when the unit price is low & you are getting more return when the unit price is high. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="">
                                            So, SIP is just absorbing the ups & downs of the market for you.

                                        <strong> Tax expense reduction:</strong> Bangladesh Income tax law considers the investment in a year in SIP as tax eligible investment for tax rebate like Sanchaypatra. You can reduce your tax expenses by investing in SIP.

                                        <strong> Develops the habit of saving & investing:</strong> Through SIP, this small amount is automatically debited from your bank account every month. This small investment is not going to bring any change to your current lifestyle but provides you a substantial saving in the future. it is easy.
                                    </li>

                                        <strong> Reduction of risk:</strong> The longer the investment horizon, the lesser the instances of negative return. Here is a graph of Crisil- AMFI equity fund ( an Indian Mutual fund) over the last 15 years showing how the instances of negative return moves towards 0% after 4 years.  Because, during the span of years, SIP absorbs the associated risks & up-downs of the market.

                                    Whenever we think about mutual funds, we think it’s like investing in the stock market directly. But that’s not the case. Mutual funds are much safer & superior profit-generating (much higher than Sanchaypatra) in the hands of an experienced fund manager. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="">
                                    By doing a SIP, you don’t have to chase the return. You just continue your investment; the return will chase YOU.

                                    Your money will be invested in stock market, fixed income, and money market. The

                                    world. In very short term, like less than one year, there are many factors including
                                    market phycology, manipulation, macro-economic factors etc. that affect the stock
                                    prices.

                                    However, in long term, stock prices tend to follow the fundamental factors of the
                                    company like profitability etc. There is a saying, in short term, stock market is a
                                    voting machine and in long term it is weighting machine.

                                    Bangladesh capital market is very small. Small amount of money can influence stock
                                    prices. But, if we look at mid to long term i.e. more than 5 years, we can
                                    confidently say that good companies with strong fundamentals with favorable buy
                                    price will provide best returns.

                                    The tricky part here is finding good companies and more challenging part is finding
                                    out reasonable prices to entry. There is a saying that astute businessmen make
                                    profits not by selling but at the time of buying.

                                                managed fund, you will get tax rebate like Sanchaypatra immediately. On
                                                an average you can save 3% - 10% tax expenses (depending up on

                                    A fund’s NAV goes up or down depending on change in market value of the assets held

                                    is a chance of the NAV going below the face value of the fund. However, such events
                                    are expected to be temporary as NAV is projected to grow in the long term with

                                <strong>This is the third item's accordion body.</strong> It is hidden by default, until
                                the
                                collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These
                                classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS
                                transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default
                                variables.
                                It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the
                                <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
